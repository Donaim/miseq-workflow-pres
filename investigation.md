We see that the best result is actually with Haploflow.

The referenceless stitcher iva version looks the worst.
The reason for this is that a good contig got covered by an anomaly contig.
But the anomaly contig is recognized by BLAST, and bot recognized by mappy.

The stitcher version is worse.
The reason for it is very similar to that of sample `HIV0913NFL-PLT14H24-NFLHIVDNA_S83`.
